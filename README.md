# minimalin reborn

[![banner](design/store/marketing-banner.png)](https://apps.getpebble.com/en_US/application/56f93a5361a01637e5000036)

Updated fork based on the origional minimalin watchface from [GringerApps](https://github.com/GringerApps/minimalin).

Minimalin is a fully customizable watchface that blends analog and digital for a modern and elegant look. <br><br>
Minimalin uses Nupe, a custom font with numbers and icons, optimized with bitmap mapping to perfectly fit the pixel grid of the Pebble watch.

Some key features of Minimalin:
* Fully configurable colors
* Weather conditions and temperature
* Date display
* Steps from Pebble Health
* Low battery icon
* Bluetooth disconnected icon (pick your favorite)
* Rainbow hand :rainbow:
